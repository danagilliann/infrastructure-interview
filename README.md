# Tech@NYU Infrastructure team challenge

Hello! This is the Tech@NYU Infrastructure team challenge.

Through this challenge you will be making a web application! This will test your ability to write code! We will be testing your ability:

- to build front-end applications
- to build modularized code
- to interact with REST APIs and our API
- to make sense of data and be able to play with it

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:TechAtNYU/infrastructure-interview.git
cd infrastructure-interview
```

Then run `npm install` (Install it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)):

```
npm install
```

Now to run the AngularJS application you should be able to run the command:

```
npm start
```

And it will be running on port 3000. You should be able to navigate to it [here](http://localhost:3000/).

We have included some things for you already! The entire web app is inside the `app` folder. The main HTML file is `index.html`, and it is what loads when you run `npm start`, and navigate to port 3000. We have imported jQuery for you already, and setup some initial lines to help you get data from our API.
